Maktaba Talib - A student's library
===================================

For the student of arabic and islamic sciences in general there exist several websites that allow searching and downloading of books. However in my view they lack certain features which I would like to implment in (yet another) DMS, namely:
- Downloading in common formats such as .pdf .doc .txt (Please no .rar and .mdb)
- Extract as much meta-data as possible and allow searching/browsing/ordering on any of the extracted fields
- Tag content with keywords
- Read books online with an easy to use inline reader and allow annotating/bookmarking of content
- Place books on your own virtual shelf/book case
- Share books with others
- Search inside books where the source format allows indexing (non-images)
- read/write reviews of books
- rate books
- Create bookmarks of pages/parts of pages
 - Bookmarks may be linked to descriptions of authors and books and other things as well?
 - These can then be rated as well so that the best descriptions rise to the top
 - Allow bookmarks to be arranged in groups (General, To Read, Research Topic A, ...)
- ...

Software identified
===================

Some software packages have been identified as possible starting points for the customizations that my desired list of features would necessitate:
- Wikindx
- Bibsonomy
- Bookreader software from http://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/bookreader

Both seem to provide very nice web interfaces and overall structure, however neither is complete for the requirements that I have.


Source materials
================

Plugins will have to be written to allow adding content from the following websites:
- waqfiyah  (Sometimes contains links to archive.org & Shamila)
- shamila.ws
- archive.org
- rapidshare/ 4share (?)
- http://islamicbookslibrary.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/dars-e-nizami-books-collections/ ( Som Dars-e-Nizami books on archive.org)
- ...
